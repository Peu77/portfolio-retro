            <p>
                I'm Emil, a software developer from Germany.
                I am 18 years old and have started programming 7 years ago,
                back then I just wanted to
                be able to write plugins for a block game, back then I could never
                have imagined that in the next few years I would be dealing with
                software, web and game development
            </p>

        <div class="card">
            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>
                I began my career as a freelancer on Fiverr,
                developing web apps and plugins for various games.
                Concurrently, I worked on my own projects,
                which served as both a source of practical
                experience and personal enjoyment.
                Over the past year, I have been employed
                in a full-stack development role, primarily utilising TypeScript
                and Go. This role has also afforded me the opportunity to gain
                expertise in infrastructure and system design,
                including working with Kubernetes and container-based applications in production.
